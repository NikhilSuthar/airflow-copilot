# ðŸ“¤ Deploying Airflowâ€¯Copilot App to Microsoft Teams

After creating your Azure Bot, follow the steps below to connect it to the Airflowâ€¯Copilot Teams app and upload the package.

## 1: Appâ€‘Level Deployment Options

|------------|---------------|------------|
| **Organizationâ€‘wide** | Teams tenant admins | Available to all users |
| **Personal scope** | Any user | Visible only to the uploader |

---

## 2: Link the Azure Bot to the Teams Manifest

1. Locate the **MicrosoftÂ AppÂ ID** from the Azure Bot you created earlier.  
   *(SeeÂ [Create Azure Bot](../quickstart/azure_bot.md) if you need a refresher.)*

2. [**Download**](https://github.com/NikhilSuthar/airflow-copilot/blob/main/manifest/manifest.zip) the Copilot Teams manifest ZIP.

3. **Extract** the ZIP and open `manifest.json`.

4. Replace every instance of **`${MICROSOFT_APP_ID}`** with your real AppÂ ID  
   *(usually appears twice).*

5. **Reâ€‘zip** exactly these three files â€” **not the folder**:

   ```
   manifest.json
   color.png
   outline.png
   ```

## 3: Upload the App to Microsoft Teams

> **Note:** Uploading custom apps may be disabled on tightlyâ€‘managed tenants. Check with your Teams admin if the options below are missing.

2. Click **Apps** in the left sidebar.
